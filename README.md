## Design and Analysis of Beams
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of beams with diverse cross-sections, meticulously comparing results obtained through Numerical and Analytical Computations. Evaluated bending moment and shear force diagrams, stress profiles (normal and shear), and beam deflection at loading points.
